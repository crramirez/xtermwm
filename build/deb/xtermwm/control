Description: Xterm Window Manager
 Xterm Window Manager is a desktop environment / window manager for
 the console.  Major features include:
.
    * The ability to run in both Xterm-like environments (Unix command
      line shells or over ssh) and as a Swing component for
      X11/Windows/Mac, with the same behavior and look-and-feel.
.
    * Image support, for both Swing and Xterm.  When running under
      Xterm, images are rendered as sixel graphic sequences.
.
    * A text terminal window / shell with good Xterm/VT100 support,
      including mouse.  Terminal windows will also resize correctly if
      using 'ptypipe'.
.
    * Support for the raw Linux console.  GPM mouse support will work
      when run inside 'lcxterm' or 'qodem'.
