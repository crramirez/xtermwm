Description: text-based window manager for console and shell
 Xterm Window Manager is a desktop environment / window manager for
 the console.  Major features include:
.
    * Tiled and windowed terminal shells with good Xterm/VT100
      support, including mouse.  Terminal shells will also resize
      correctly on Linux/Mac due to the included 'ptypipe' utility.
      (XtermWM can even be run inside itself with full feature
      support.)
.
    * Virtual desktops and desktop pager widget.
.
    * Cascading/overlapping/floating windows with mouse-draggable move
      and resizing.
.
    * Tiled/paned windows with mouse selection and divider
      mouse-draggable resizing.
.
    * A plugin system for adding custom widgets, windows,
      screensavers, and other functions.
.
    * The ability to run in Xterm-like environments (Unix command line
      shells or over ssh) and as a Swing component for
      X11/Windows/Mac, with the same behavior and look-and-feel.  The
      mouse can also work for the raw Linux console when GPM is
      installed and XtermWM is run inside 'LCxterm'.
.
    * Image support, for both Swing and Xterm.  When running under
      Xterm, images are rendered as sixel graphic sequences.
.
    * Shared sessions.  See additional notes below.
