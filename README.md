Xterm Window Manager
====================

Xterm Window Manager (XtermWM) is a desktop environment / window
manager for the console.  Major features include:

  * The ability to run in both Xterm-like environments (Unix command
    line shells or over ssh) and as a Swing component for
    X11/Windows/Mac, with the same behavior and look-and-feel.

  * Image support, for both Swing and Xterm.  When running under
    Xterm, images are rendered as sixel graphic sequences.

  * A text terminal window / shell with good Xterm/VT100 support,
    including mouse.  Terminal windows will also resize correctly if
    using 'ptypipe'.

  * Support for the raw Linux console.  GPM mouse support will work
    when run inside 'lcxterm' or 'qodem'.
