Xterm Window Manager Installation
=================================

Xterm Window Manager (XtermWM) can be built in several ways to support
different target platforms.  The most common build is the
autoconf-based build described in further detail below.  Other
makefiles are provided in the build/ subdirectory for the following
compilers/platforms:

```
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Makefile name    | Compiler           | Target Platform                  |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Makefile.generic | cc                 | POSIX / Linux                    |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|
```

Makefiles are run from this top-level directory.  For example, to use
the Makefile.generic to produce a text-mode ncurses build:

```
$ make -f build/Makefile.generic clean
$ make -f build/Makefile.generic
```


Autoconf
--------

XtermWM is commonly installed using the GNU autoconf system.  The
following is the standard autoconf installation:

  1. Type `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the XtermWM program and
     documentation.  By default, `make install' will install the
     package's files in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You
     can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by
     giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'

  5. You can remove the XtermWM binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package
     for a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

Note that if you build XtermWM directly from a source repository, you
must have automake installed and use that to generate Makefile.in.
You can choose to execute `./autogen.sh` and skip step 1 above (as it
already runs configure); or run `aclocal && automake && autoconf'
before step 1 above.



Debian Packages
---------------

Debian build directories are provided in build/deb.  A 'xtermwm' deb
can be built via the following commands:

  $ cp -r build/deb/xtermwm debian
  $ dpkg-buildpackage

Note that the XtermWM tarball will need to be renamed to
xtermwm_{version}.orig.tar.gz in the parent directory.


RPM Packages
------------

An RPM spec file to create the 'xtermwm' package is provided in
build/rpm.
